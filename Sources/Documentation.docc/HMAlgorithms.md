# ``HMAlgorithms``

Commonly used data structures and algorithms for Swift

This package builds on [Swift Algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) and [Swift Collections](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections). The maintainers of this package would like to see everything in those packages, and this one, included in the standard library.

##### Name

The full name of this package is "[Hemiprocne Mystacea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moustached_treeswift) Algorithms". That's kind of long, so it's shortened in code to `HMAlgorithms`.

### Usage Examples

You've got the source code, so aside from reading this documentation, see the **Tests** folder for example usage! ðŸ˜º
